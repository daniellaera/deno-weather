# deno-weather
That is all the code we needed to write, now open terminal and write the run command as:

`deno run --allow-net weather.ts`

The command requires an addition of — allow-net which gives the deno command to access network permissions.
Now go to localhost:5000/cityname/countryname and get the weather at your desired location.
That’s it! You have successfully made an API using Deno.
Thank You!
